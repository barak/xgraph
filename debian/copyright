Nonfree forks:

  Paul Walker at University of Illinois added animations and
  derivatives.  This code is under a highly non-free license.  Two
  forks based on this non-free code are available, but until the
  license is fixed they cannot be packaged for Debian.  They are not
  even legally allowed into non-free.

    Something described as version 12.1 comes from
    http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/xgraph/index.html
    http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/dist/xgraph-12.1.tar.gz dated 20-Dec-1999.

    Another version is available via anonymous CVS described on
    http://www.cactuscode.org/VizTools/xgraph.html
    or currently,
    git svn clone --stdlayout http://svn.cactuscode.org/VizTools/xgraph/
