README FROM LINUX VERSION.  IN THIS RELEASE, THERE'S NO NEED TO APPLY THE
PATCH - IT'S ALREADY BEEN APPLIED.

Xgraph should run on your Linux box. Untar xgraph.orig.tar to get the man page, 
examples, etc. (it will create xgraph-11 directory). To apply the patch,
go to xgraph-11 and do

        patch < xgraph.patch


To rebuild:
        xmkmf
        make
        
To test:
        there is a directory in xgraph-11 called examples. go to xgraph-11
        and do
                xgraph examples/xgtest.xg

Bugs:
        the geometry command-line option doesn't seem to work with twm but
        works fine with olvwm.

enjoy!
